## About

This is a student project done with [@ShadrachPatrick](https://github.com/ShadrachPatrick) for the "Audio and Image Formats" lecture. It's a walking simulator to explore a space station with different sounds effects, like ambiant, static or dynamic sounds. The goal of this project was to use 5.1 audio channels in Unity3D to create a surround sound experience.

*Use a 5.1 soundsystem for the best experience.*
